# Flight-prediction
This is a freelance project done to get my hands wet and keep myself busy :)

This is aimed at predicting the flight price using various flight parameters. Prices varies with different change in parameters. Machine learning regression technique is used in this project to learn from the training data and make accurate predictions for unseen datasets. Packages used include pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Seaborn, etc.
